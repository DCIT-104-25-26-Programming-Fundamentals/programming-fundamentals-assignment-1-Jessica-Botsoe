# PROGRAMMING FUNDAMENTALS — Assignment 8
# Topic: Lists of Dictionaries, Loops, and Functions

#
# TASK: Student Record Management System
#
# Build a console-based program that stores and manages student information.
# Each student record must contain:
#
#   - Name   : the student's full name (text)
#   - ID     : a unique student ID number (e.g. 20240001)
#   - Scores : a list of scores from multiple assessments (e.g. [75, 88, 90])
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# FEATURES YOUR PROGRAM MUST SUPPORT
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#   1. Add a Student
#      - Ask the user to enter the student's name and ID.
#      - Ask how many scores to enter, then collect each score one by one.
#      - Save the student record and confirm it was added.
#
#   2. Display All Students
#      - Print a formatted table showing every student's:
#          Name, ID, individual scores, and their average score.
#      - If no students have been added yet, print a message saying so.
#
#   3. Calculate Average Score for a Specific Student
#      - Ask the user to enter a student ID.
#      - Find the student and calculate the average of their scores.
#      - Display the result. If the ID is not found, print an error message.
#
#   4. Quit
#      - End the program.
#

# HOW THE MENU SHOULD LOOK

#      STUDENT RECORD SYSTEM MENU

# EXPECTED INTERACTION EXAMPLE
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#   Enter your choice (1-4): 1
#   Student name: Alice Mensah
#   Student ID: 20240001
#   How many scores? 3
#   Enter score 1: 78
#   Enter score 2: 85
#   Enter score 3: 90
#   Student "Alice Mensah" added successfully.
#
#   Enter your choice (1-4): 2
#   --------------------------------------------------
#   Name           ID          Scores         Average
#   --------------------------------------------------
#   Alice Mensah   20240001    78, 85, 90     84.33
#   --------------------------------------------------
#
#   Enter your choice (1-4): 3
#   Enter student ID: 20240001
#   Alice Mensah's average score: 84.33
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# REQUIREMENTS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# - Store all student records in a list of dictionaries.
#   Example structure:
#       student = {
#           "name": "Alice Mensah",
#           "id": 20240001,
#           "scores": [78, 85, 90]
#       }
# - Average scores should be rounded to 2 decimal places.
# - Each feature MUST be implemented in its own function (see scaffold below).
# - Handle invalid menu choices and missing student IDs gracefully.
#

# YOUR CODE BELOW — remove the # symbols from the scaffold and fill it in
